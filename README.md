# About the working of IMS
In this IMS there is two sections, one is to add stock to the inventory. This is done as, if there is a updation  of stock in existing items in inventory, we can update the quantity of the same or if we have a new item we can add complete details if the item to IMS.IMS-Updation_of_Inventory.ipynb iscontaining code for stock management and record.json contains stock details
The other section is to make purchases and update the stock in IMS accordingly. If we have enough quantity of product to statisfy user needs we will generate a bill with total amount along with time and date, if we have less quantity of product IMS will ask whether the consumer wants to purchase the available quantity and then proceeds or if we have no item in stock we will print accordingly.IMS-Sales.ipynb is containing for sales and sales.json contains sales report.
